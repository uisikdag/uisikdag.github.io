Biography
======
I am currently working as a Professor of Construction Informatics at the Department of Architecture in [Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University](https://msgsu.edu.tr/akademik/mimarlik-fakultesi/bolumler/mimarlik/). 
I hold a Civil Engineering BSc degree from [Balikesir University](https://www.balikesir.edu.tr/site/birim/insaat-muhendisligi-bolumu-293102),
MSc. in Construction Informatics from [University of Greenwich](https://www.gre.ac.uk/subjects/construction#postgraduate%20-%20taught) supervised by 
[Keith Jones](https://www.aru.ac.uk/people/keith-jones) and advisor [Robert (Bob) Falconer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-falconer-77b6665)
PhD in Construction Informatics from the [University of Salford](https://hub.salford.ac.uk/uprise-digital-built-environment/) supervisied by 
[Ghassan Aouad](https://www.adu.ac.ae/about-adu/our-leadership1/leadership-team/professor-ghassan-aouad),[Jason Underwood](https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/jason-underwood)
,[Nigel Trodd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigeltrodd), and informal advisors [Volker Coors](https://www.hft-stuttgart.de/p/volker-coors),

My MSc was on the development of an [Expert System(AI)for Bridge Design](files/msc_thesis.pdf) (1999), here is the [full software](files/msc_code.xls) which needs to [unblock macros](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-en/microsoft-365-apps/security/internet-macros-blocked)
to run.My PhD started by looking at how an IT Strategy for Turkish Construction Industry can be developed, which resulted with my first [journal paper](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09699980410547595/full/html)
 and my only unpublished [Turkish Construction IT Vision](https://zenodo.org/records/1331943)book. My following research was on [BIM GIS Integration](https://salford-repository.worktribe.com/output/1434038/towards-the-implementation-of-building-information-models-in-geospatial-context)
:2007, where I developed a [software](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjWRQUTDgLAPZ0EGWbw3UMj27GU4nMYFZ) for persisting IFC objects in a 3D GeoDatabase. During and after my PhD 
I worked as a senior research fellow at Coventry University with [Nigel Trodd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigeltrodd) in 2004 on Intelligent Cities [IntelCities](https://www.itas.kit.edu/english/projects_pask04_intelcity.php)
where I learned about advanced distributed computing frameworks such as [COM+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model) and [CORBA](https://www.corba.org/), which later helped me to understand [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)
and finally [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST), this has encouraged me to worked on [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) and later on [DesignPatterns]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) and [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things), all this path is summarized in my 
[BIM and IoT Integration Patterns](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-21825-0) book. In addition,in 2013 I worked at University of Central Lancashire with [Jack Goulding](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-goulding-a0412614), on various
on [BIM 2.0](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/14714171111148990/full/html)


I have started teaching in 1999 and since then I have worked full and part time at (chronological order:) 
Ege University, Beykent University, Istanbul Kultur University, Istanbul University, Istanbul Esenyurt University, 
Bogazici University, Istanbul Technical University. I have worked as a senior researcher
