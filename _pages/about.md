Biography
======
I am currently working as a Professor of Construction Informatics at the Department of Architecture in Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University. I have a Civil Engineering BSc degree from Balikesir University, MSc. in Construction Informatics from the University of Greenwich, and PhD in Construction Informatics from the University of Salford. I would express my deepest respect and gratitude to (all my supervisiors Keith Jones,Ghassan Aouad,Jason Underwood,Nigel Trodd and in addition Volker Coors and Sisi Zlatanova, who helped me a lot during my MSc and PhD) and all my primary, secondary school teachers and university academics, and to all my former and current students and former and current research partners and collegues, who has supported / supporting me and thought me that reseach is a path that "which you can never walk alone". My MSc research was about AI (Expert Systems) which I completed in 1999 and my Ph.D. research was about BIM-3D GIS integration which I completed in 2007. My current research interests are in Machine and Deep Learning, Internet of Things, 3D GIS, BIM and Structural Equation Modeling. I have started teaching in 1999 and since then I have worked full and part time at (chronological order:) Ege University, Beykent University, Istanbul Kultur University, Istanbul University, Istanbul Esenyurt University, Bogazici University, Istanbul Technical University. In addition,I have worked as a senior researcher at Coventry University (2004), and the University of Central Lancashire (2013). I have given guest lectures and talks in different organisations including TU Delft, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, HfT Stuttgart, Curtin University Malaysia, Yildiz Technical University, Balikesir University, Turgut Özal University, Sakarya University, Fırat University, Eskişehir Technical University, Gazi University.
