Biography
======
I am currently working as a Professor of Construction Informatics at the Department of Architecture in [Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University](https://msgsu.edu.tr/akademik/mimarlik-fakultesi/bolumler/mimarlik/). 
I hold a Civil Engineering BSc degree from [Balikesir University](https://www.balikesir.edu.tr/site/birim/insaat-muhendisligi-bolumu-293102),
MSc. in Construction Informatics from [University of Greenwich](https://www.gre.ac.uk/subjects/construction#postgraduate%20-%20taught) supervised by 
[Keith Jones](https://www.aru.ac.uk/people/keith-jones) and advisor [Robert (Bob) Falconer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-falconer-77b6665), 
PhD in Construction Informatics from the [University of Salford](https://hub.salford.ac.uk/uprise-digital-built-environment/) supervisied by 
[Ghassan Aouad](https://www.adu.ac.ae/about-adu/our-leadership1/leadership-team/professor-ghassan-aouad), [Jason Underwood](https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/jason-underwood), 
[Nigel Trodd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigeltrodd), and my informal advisors [Volker Coors](https://www.hft-stuttgart.de/p/volker-coors),
 [Sisi Zlatanova](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-sisi-zlatanova).

Research Paths
======

Artificial Intelligence
------
My MSc was on the development of an [Expert System (AI) for Bridge Design](files/msc_thesis.pdf) :98-99, where I developed an MS Excel based [software](files/msc_code.xls).
Please [unblock macros](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-en/microsoft-365-apps/security/internet-macros-blocked) to try it.

Construction Informatics
------
My PhD journey started by looking at IT Strategy for Turkish Construction Industry :01-02, which resulted with my first [journal paper](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09699980410547595/full/html)
 and my unpublished [Turkish Construction IT Vision](https://zenodo.org/records/1331943) book.Following this, our joint efforts together with 
 [Turkish Association of Informatics](https://www.tbd.org.tr/) have resulted in an 
academic conference series namely [Informatics for Builgding and Cities](https://www.tbd.org.tr/yapi-ve-kennte-bilisim-iv-bildiriler-kitabi-tbd-tbb-tmbd/) which has been organized 4 times, till 2006.
Later I started Construction Informatics [workshop](https://insaatbilisim.weebly.com/) in Turkish Academic Informatics [conference](https://www.ab.org.tr/) which ran for several years.

BIM and GIS Integration
------
 My PhD research :02-07 was on [BIM GIS Integration](https://salford-repository.worktribe.com/output/1434038/towards-the-implementation-of-building-information-models-in-geospatial-context)
, where I developed a [software](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjWRQUTDgLAPZ0EGWbw3UMj27GU4nMYFZ) for transferring IFC objects from an ISO10303 [database](https://jotneconnect.com/products/express-data-manager/)
 and persisting into a 3D GeoDatabase as [multipatch](https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/sitecore-archive/Files/Pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/multipatch-geometry-type.pdf) features.
Three key outputs were a [summary](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1474034608000499) of my PhD, an intro to the [indoor model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0198971513000434)
which I developed, and a discussion on how the BIM-GIS integration benefits in case of a [fire response](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17452007.2007.9684636) scenario.
Two of these outputs have now become my [mostly cited](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?hl=tr&authuser=1&user=weQbA-EAAAAJ) academic papers.

BIM for the common good
------ 
After I graduate from my PhD, I and my supervisor [Jason Underwood](https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/jason-underwood), worked on publishing the 1st edited/multi-author 
[Handbook of Research on BIM ](https://www.igi-global.com/book/handbook-research-building-information-modeling/37234) in academia, the book had a very similar name with the other
[BIM Handbook](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119287568), due to the name of the series that we have published.In :13 I worked at University of Central Lancashire 
with [Jack Goulding](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-goulding-a0412614), on [BIM 2.0](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/14714171111148990/full/html).

BIM & IoT Integration for Smarter Cities
------
During my PhD I worked as a Senior Researcher at Coventry University with [Nigel Trodd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigeltrodd) in :04 on Smart Cities with [IntelCities](https://www.itas.kit.edu/english/projects_pask04_intelcity.php)
project, where I learned about distributed computing and service oriented approaches for integration, and  coded in frameworks such as 
[COM+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model) and [CORBA](https://www.corba.org/), 
which later helped me to code in [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) and [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) styles. 
This has encouraged me to work on implementation of [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) and 
[Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) and [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) 
for/within BIM based information sharing. Key outputs can be found in this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580509001769)
and this [one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580512000696).
Path from SOA to IoT is summarized with many Design Patterns in my [BIM and IoT Integration Patterns](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-21825-0) book.
